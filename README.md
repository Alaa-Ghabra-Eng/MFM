Hellow friends,

Greetings,

I'm a junior .Net developer and this is my first personal project. 'MFM' stands for My Financial Manager which is a simple budget manager built with ASP.NET Core framework.
The project serves as a simple personal budget manager with the abbility to add and update transactions in addition to the possiblity of categorizing the transactions and calculating expenses and income. 
This project is no longer maintained since I'm building a new project with the same functions but using a different stucture. the new stucture is way more dynamic since it comprises a Restful API and a seperate web application that conusmes the services. 


Thank you.
