Hellow friends,

Greetings,

I'm a junior .Net developer and this is my first personal project. 'MFM' stands for My Financial Manager and it's a .Net based project comprising a Restful API to serve the application's main functions and a Web Interface build using Blazor
that consumes the aformentiond  Web API. Please leave your comments and feel free to use the project as it suits you. 

Kindly notice that the current code represents an ASP.NET Core web application and It is functional at the moment but I'm currently refactoring the project according to the new structure I mentioned earlier. 

Thank you.
